I am an individual who enjoys experimenting, thinking, learning, and creating.

I am currently a graduate student in the elite statistics program at the School of Statistics, Renmin University of China. I am also a research intern at **[GenSI Lab](https://www.gensi-thuair.com/#/portal_home)**, THU-AIR, where I work on cutting-edge generative AI research.

My research focuses on **Generative Models** with applications in natural language processing and computational biology.

- 💬 **Diffusion Language Models**: Exploring diffusion-based approaches for text generation, understanding, and controllable generation
- 🧬 **Molecular Generation**: Developing generative models for small molecule design and drug discovery
- 🧪 **Protein Generation**: Advancing protein structure generation and protein design using deep learning
